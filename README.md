# Ship, Captain, and Crew #

Ship, Captain, and Crew (also referred to as Cap'n, Bos'n, Mate; Ship of Fools; Clickety Clack; 6-5-4[1] or Destroyer) is a drinking game played with five dice. The game can be played with as few as two people, but is usually played in a group of five or more. The object of the game is to roll a six (the "ship"), a five ("captain"), and a four ("crew") with three dice, and get the highest score with the other two dice ("the ship's cargo"). In other versions, a four is the "mate" and the remaining dice are the crew.
